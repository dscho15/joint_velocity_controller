# joint_velocity_controller

## The purpose

The Franka Emika Pnada has several available controller interfaces for the user through their API. One of these, the joint-velocity-controller interface, is to be implemented for a project I'm currently working on in collaboration with Cheng Fang, Assistent Professor at SDU Robotics.

## Proposal

- Two interfaces are designed: one utilizing euler angles and the other quaternions.
